Project Summary — Association Mining on Netflix Content Data

This project applies association mining techniques to a Netflix dataset to uncover meaningful patterns in viewer behavior and the relationships between different types of content on the platform. Using R and libraries such as arules and arulesViz, the dataset was transformed into a transaction structure suitable for rule mining. Through the Apriori and Eclat algorithms, frequent itemsets, high-confidence rules, and key variables—such as movie/TV distinctions, ratings, release years, and country of origin—were analyzed. The project places emphasis on understanding how data is manipulated step-by-step, interpreting support, confidence, and lift measures, and evaluating visualizations that illustrate the most influential associations.

The analysis reveals that Netflix viewership trends are dominated by movies and TV shows—particularly TV-MA/TV-14 content, recent release years, and U.S. productions, with notable international engagement (e.g., India). High-confidence rules show strong relationships among genres like kids’ programming, comedy, reality TV, and multi-season shows, suggesting binge-watch behaviors. Insights from association rules provide strategic recommendations for content acquisition, curation, and recommendation system tuning. By linking measurable viewer preferences to actionable business decisions, this project demonstrates how unsupervised learning methods can enhance content strategy, improve user experience, and support data-driven decision-making on streaming platforms.
