Text Mining & Word Cloud Analysis of The Hobbit

This project applies foundational text-mining and natural language processing techniques to analyze The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. Using R and libraries such as tm, SnowballC, wordcloud, and RColorBrewer, the project walks through the complete preprocessing pipeline: importing raw text, cleaning and normalizing the corpus, removing stopwords, stemming, and constructing a term-document matrix. Through these steps, unstructured narrative text is transformed into a tidy, analyzable dataset. The analysis identifies the most frequent words in the novel and visualizes their prominence through a word cloud and bar plot, revealing key themes, recurring characters, and narrative patterns.

Beyond frequency counts, the project explores deeper text relationships through association mining, highlighting how terms like gold correlate with words tied to value, location, and action. These insights demonstrate how text-mining approaches can extract structure and meaning from literary content, supporting tasks like summarization, theme identification, or recommendation-system development. The project showcases practical experience in NLP preprocessing, data interpretation, visualization, and applying analytical methods to understand complex textual data.
