Netflix Content Analysis & Data Mining Project

This project explores content trends, user preferences, and strategic insights using a publicly available Netflix dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains 8,807 records and 12 variables, including title type, genre, director, cast, release year, rating, and runtime. The objective of this project is to identify actionable insights that support content strategy, user retention, recommendation system improvement, and forecasting of high-value content. Using data mining techniques, our team aimed to understand how patterns in Netflix’s catalog reflect viewer behaviors, market trends, and opportunities for strategic growth.

We began with comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to assess data quality, identify missing or inconsistent values, and explore patterns across ratings, runtimes, genres, and release years. The dataset was relatively clean, requiring minor imputation for missing cast/director information and conversion of variables into appropriate formats. EDA revealed that movies dominate the Netflix catalog, recent releases (post-2010) appear far more frequently, and adult-oriented content (e.g., TV-MA, TV-14) is especially common. These trends offer valuable context for content acquisition, viewer engagement strategies, and enhancements to recommendation algorithms.

Building on the EDA findings, we applied association rule mining and clustering techniques to uncover deeper patterns. Association mining highlighted strong relationships among content type, ratings, release periods, and geographic origin—particularly the prominence of U.S. and Indian productions. Meanwhile, clustering (using k-means, hierarchical methods, and validation metrics such as the Elbow, Silhouette, and Gap Statistic methods) grouped content based on shared attributes to reveal meaningful structural patterns, such as genre-runtime clusters and release year groupings. Together, these methods helped address our business questions by revealing user preference trends, guiding recommendation system improvements, and informing strategic decisions about which types of content are most likely to drive user engagement and platform growth.
