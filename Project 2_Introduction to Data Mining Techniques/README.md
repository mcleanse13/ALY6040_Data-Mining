Mushroom Classification with Decision Trees and Random Forests: Predicting Edible vs. Poisonous Varieties

This project applies data mining techniques like decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics. Using a dataset containing over 8,000 records and 23 attributes, the analysis began with a detailed walkthrough of the R code used to structure, clean, and prepare the data. Steps included examining the dataset structure, removing redundant variables, identifying perfect splits across features, and creating training and testing sets for modeling. With decision trees as the primary classification method, the model identified odor as the most significant predictor, serving as the root node and branching into additional attributes such as spore-print-color, population, and gill-size. Pruning, prediction, and evaluation using a confusion matrix demonstrated extremely strong model performance, with no false positives or false negatives and near-perfect accuracy metrics.

Based on the model’s insights, the project provides practical recommendations for identifying potentially poisonous mushrooms, emphasizing the strong predictive power of odor and spore-print-color combinations. The results show clear separations between edible and poisonous classifications, making the decision tree a reliable tool for novice mushroom foragers or stakeholders concerned with food safety. Additional suggestions include incorporating new variables and exploring alternative classification models to enhance predictive robustness. Overall, the project demonstrates how data mining methods can uncover meaningful patterns in complex biological datasets and translate them into actionable, real-world guidance.
