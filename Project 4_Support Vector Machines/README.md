This project applies Support Vector Machines (SVM), a supervised learning technique, to a heart disease dataset containing 300 patient records and 14 clinical attributes. The analysis focuses on building, tuning, and evaluating SVM models using both linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The dataset is partitioned into training and testing subsets, and preprocessing steps such as data standardization and cross-validation are implemented to ensure model robustness. Multiple SVM configurations are explored by adjusting key hyperparameters—including the cost parameter (C) and, for RBF models, the sigma value—to understand how they influence classification performance. Confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and kappa statistics are used to measure predictive effectiveness across different models.

Through systematic tuning and comparison, the project demonstrates that SVMs can achieve strong predictive accuracy for identifying heart disease, with linear models in particular showing the highest accuracy and kappa values after optimization. The analysis provides insights into how flexible margins, lower C values, and appropriate kernel selection can significantly improve model generalization. Based on these findings, the project recommends prioritizing the tuned linear SVM model for future predictive tasks and suggests additional exploration of clinical variables or external demographic features to further strengthen the classification framework. The project illustrates how SVMs can effectively support data-driven decision-making in healthcare by enabling more reliable early detection models.
