ALY6040: Data Mining

This course on Data Mining Applications provided hands-on experience in extracting actionable insights from complex datasets using a variety of analytical techniques. Over the six projects, we explored data from multiple domains, including textual analysis of The Hobbit, franchise sales and customer data, and streaming content on Netflix. Each project emphasized the full data mining workflow: from data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and visualization, to advanced modeling techniques such as association rule mining, clustering, and sentiment analysis. These projects demonstrated the importance of structuring raw, heterogeneous data into analyzable formats and deriving meaningful patterns to answer specific business or analytical questions.

Throughout the course, key competencies were developed in applying R and Python packages, generating visualizations, performing statistical analyses, and interpreting results for stakeholders. Practical skills included mining text to uncover key narrative themes, analyzing franchise performance metrics, exploring viewer preferences in streaming platforms, and refining recommendation systems. The culmination of these projects highlighted the ability to connect data-driven insights to actionable strategies, demonstrating how data mining can optimize decision-making, enhance user experiences, and support organizational growth across various industries.
