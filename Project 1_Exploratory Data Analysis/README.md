Exploratory Data Analysis of the Boston Housing Dataset: Uncovering Patterns and Drivers of Home Prices

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the well-known Boston Housing dataset, which contains 506 observations and 14 variables describing socioeconomic, geographic, environmental, and structural attributes of homes in the Boston area. Using R, the analysis involved examining data types, exploring distributions, calculating summary statistics, and visualizing patterns to understand how various factors contribute to housing prices. Initial data inspection showed the dataset was mostly clean, with no missing values or duplications; however, graphical analysis revealed several meaningful outliers in variables such as crime rate (CRIM), proportion of land zoned for large lots (ZN), and demographic attributes such as the B variable. These visualizations, combined with summary statistics, laid the foundation for understanding the structure and quality of the data prior to deeper analysis.

The second phase of the project involved assessing relationships between attributes using covariance, correlation matrices, scatterplots, and ggplot visualizations. Strong relationships emerged, such as the positive correlation between median home value (MEDV) and the average number of rooms (RM), as well as the association between tax rate (TAX) and non-retail business acreage (INDUS). Conversely, attributes like CHAS (proximity to the Charles River) showed little influence on most other variables. By identifying patterns, trends, and potential drivers of housing value, the analysis highlighted how socioeconomic factors, property characteristics, and community features interact within Boston's housing market. The insights gained offer a foundation for future modeling, guiding next steps such as deeper cleaning, feature engineering, and further investigation into how these relationships may influence real-estate decision-making and community planning.
